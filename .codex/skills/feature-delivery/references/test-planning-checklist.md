# Test Planning Checklist

1. Unit-level behavior
- core functions and edge paths

2. Integration behavior
- API/service boundaries
- compatibility with existing consumers

3. Data safety
- migration validation
- rollback safety checks

4. UX and localization (if relevant)
- user-visible behavior
- translation parity and layout checks

5. Regression checks
- previously working critical flows
