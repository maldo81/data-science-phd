# Codex Tooling (`.codex`)

This folder contains Codex-specific glue for the project.

Use:
- `.codex/commands/*` for reusable command shortcuts
- `.codex/skills/*` as mirrored copies from `.agents/skills/*` (auto-generated by apply script)
- `.codex/reference/*` for compact local operational references

Do not treat `.codex/skills/*` as canonical; edit `.agents/skills/*` first.
