# PIV Workflow (Plan -> Implement -> Validate)

Use this workflow for any non-trivial change.

## 1) Plan

- Clarify outcome and acceptance criteria.
- Identify docs/specs that govern the change.
- List risks, constraints, and non-goals.

## 2) Implement

- Make minimal changes aligned to the plan.
- Keep commits focused and reviewable.
- Avoid hidden side effects.

## 3) Validate

- Run relevant tests/checks.
- Validate behavior against written specs.
- Capture any gaps or follow-up tasks.

## 4) Iterate

- Update docs when behavior/scope changed.
- Record notable decisions in project history/changelog.
- Refine the next plan slice if work continues.
