# Init Project

Initialize local development safely.

Checklist:
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (or project runtime).
2. Install dependencies.
3. Configure environment variables without committing secrets.
4. Run migrations/setup scripts only if required.
5. Start app/services and run quick health checks.
6. Record project-specific setup notes in `.project/runbooks/`.
