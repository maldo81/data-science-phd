# False-Positive Guards

Before reporting a finding, verify:
- The issue is introduced or made worse by current changes.
- The concern is not already intentionally handled elsewhere.
- The claim can be tied to concrete evidence in changed code.
- The issue is not purely stylistic unless it creates practical risk.

Prefer fewer high-confidence findings over long speculative lists.
