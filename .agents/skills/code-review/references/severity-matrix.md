# Severity Matrix

- `critical`: High likelihood of data loss, security breach, privilege escalation, outage, or irreversible harm.
- `high`: Significant functional regression, broken contracts, unsafe migration path, or major compliance risk.
- `medium`: Meaningful reliability or maintainability risk that should be fixed soon.
- `low`: Minor quality issue with limited immediate impact.

Default ordering in reports: `critical` -> `high` -> `medium` -> `low`.
