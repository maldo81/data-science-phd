# Claude Tooling (`.claude`)

This folder contains Claude-specific glue for the project.

Use:
- `.claude/commands/*` for reusable command shortcuts
- `.claude/skills/*` as mirrored copies from `.agents/skills/*` (auto-generated by apply script)
- `.claude/hooks/*` for optional hook templates (experimental pack)

Do not treat `.claude/skills/*` as canonical; edit `.agents/skills/*` first.
